ANALYSIS ON FEASIBILITY OF PLAY “FEVER”; CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN

1. PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS

The key objective of this report is to support Louise in providing a detailed analysis on the viability of her campaign on how realistic her expected budget and setting goals to make the campaign a success based on the launched date and funding goals.


2. PROJECT BACKGROUND

Crowdfunding can be defined as one of the most successful ways of raising funds for a project and its scope has constantly expanded in the recent years making more attractive alternate. However, for a successful campaign, it requires carefully crafted strategies, feasible budget & goals and financially supporting 
backers who will pledge to fund the campaign.

Louise is the owner of the Crowdfunding Project of the play “Fever”, and this is her first experience in organizing a such campaign. She has a budget of over $10,000 and expect to provide a detail analysis on different aspects of the campaign to make it a success.

This report will cover the campaign analysis based on
• Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date
• Outcomes Based on Goals


3. PROJECT ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES

3.1 Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date

Based on the analysis of the Theatre outcome based on the launch date, it does not provide any concrete pattern to say that launch date has any significant impact, however, it is assumed before comprehending any underlying patterns, one needs to normalize the data without comparing absolute values. I created a separate graph with percentage of success, failure and cancellations for each month (link). As it is seen in two graphs, the one with the absolute values look deceiving to show that month of May has an advantage. However, looking at percentages, the graphs show Month of May still as the leading month with the highest percentage but by an insignificant margin. Other notable observation is months of January and December has relatively low success ratios – one potential explanation would be people are busier with holidays and getting started with the new year and/or those two months are likely to have the highest financial constraints avoiding them to be more generous on crowdfunding projects. Hence, if Louise is looking to launch the campaign, the only viable advice to give is to avoid January and December. Month of May seems to have led to higher success rate than any other month but still with 31% failure rate.

The average success percentage of across the twelve months is 61% with a standard deviation (population) of 0.04%. The low standard deviation supports the claim above to say that there is very low fluctuation between months with no clear outliers with significantly higher success or lower success.

Challenges:
• The use of absolute values without any normalization presents a challenge to do any meaningful comparison and worse could lead to sub-par decisions. Hence, I created a separate graph with percentages to get a better view of current data based on the launched date – the new graph (link) is also in the GitHub.
• The lack of any patterns based on the launch date could be due to the two factors:
a. The success of the launch date is insignificant.
b. We could increase the granularity to see whether the actual day of the launched project is significant – the day of the week.


3.2 Outcomes Based on Goals

Looking at the “Outcomes Based on Goals” (Refer Line Graph : Outcome Based on Goals, xxxxxxxx) Graph shows higher percentage of success for goals below $5,000 over failed percentage. Another pocket of success is shown between $35,000 to $40,000 but the success percentage is still slightly less than what it is below $5,000. Any range outside of these two regions shows a higher failed percentage over the respective success range. However, it is safe to assume that goals below $5,000 is the safest region to achieve success.

The average success percentage across the said financial goal categories is 45% while the standard deviation is 0.25. Again, the low standard deviation means the fluctuations of the success percentage is comparatively low. Given the low standard deviation there is no significant variation of the percentage across different goal categories. 

Challenges

• The graph shows two regions with higher success percentages over failed ones, however, with the amount of information at hand, it is safe to assume that there is not enough information to predict the outcome only using the goals. Goals alone cannot explain why there are two regions with higher success rate over failed ones. There could be other factors such as economic reasons, higher unemployment, that might have affected these observations and without proper analysis and holistic view of the data it is not safe to make any predictions just based on goals. For, Louise, the safe and sound advice would be to keep the goal below $5,000 if we are only use the goals.

4. CONCLUSION

4.1 Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Date

As we conclude that the success of the campaign does not rely on the launch date, it is recommended that Louise could have the campaign during any of the month of the year except at the beginning and at the end. However, there is a significant ratio of failed percentage across the months with the lowest being the Month of May. If Louise wants to increase her odds of getting the campaign a success, the month of May presents the highest probability and still not a guarantee though. 

4.2 Outcomes Based on Goals
Again, Goals does not present any indication on guaranteed success but varying degree of probabilities of success across different goal categories. However, setting a lower goal can increase the probability of success significantly (anything below $5,000). However, there is still a significant failure rate in that category as well. Given the Louise’s goal is $10,000+ it has a slight advantage (54% vs 46% for success) but one alternative would be to split the project into multiple smaller ones to increase her odds significantly.

4.3 Final Decision
It is hard to say any connection between the success of the project and either the launch date or the set goals of the project. While those two factors hint different aspects that Louise can use to increase her odds of getting the project to succeed those do not guarantee a definite success. Moving forward, we either need to increase granularity of the ranges to see whether finer levels relate to the success or find other aspects that we can use to predict the success of the project.
